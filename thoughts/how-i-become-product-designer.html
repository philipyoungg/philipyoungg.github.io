It starts from my childhood, early business stories that I did, how I decided to learn to code and design, and how I ended up working with clients from all over the world.</p>
<h2>Childhood</h2><p>I was born from a middle class family. My parents are strict—in a thrifty way. For example, I live in tropical country. My friends could turn on their air conditioner for 24/7. In contrast, I could only open them from 9PM to 5AM. My father made sure we turned it off everyday at 5AM—all to save money on electricity. </p>
<p>You know tissue? Back when I was a kid, my parents split single sheet of tissue vertically into two! By the end of the process, one pack of tissue eventually become two. Talk about being thrifty!</p>
<p>I thought that was normal, until I went to school. I figure my friends could open their air-con 24/7; they regularly get pocket money (I didn’t) to bought food! This is particularly interesting. One day, my mom didn’t cook any food. She gave me IDR 5,000 (~USD 0.8). I bought spaghetti and until now, I remember vividly how it tasted. It’s the best meal I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>This upbringing from my Dad triggered me to find my own money as early as 8 years old. Instead of spending my money, I saved them up, bought rare Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh card, and sold them with premium prices to friends in school. That’s how I made my first money.</p>
<h2>Starting my business</h2><p>One day, I got introduced to computer. Naturally, I played a lot of games and downloaded movies and music. But there’s one problem: at that time, one website dominates all movie, music, and games. It’s called Rapidshare. To download at full speed, I needed to pay for it. A solid 5 bucks per month. </p>
<p>That’s a lot of money for me. How could I get that kind of money? I immediately started to do my homework. I googled and found blogs describing how to get Rapidshare account for free. One of the blog shows that you could fill up surveys and get paid for it.</p>
<p>I’m ecstatic. I started to fill some surveys. But then, something crossed my mind: if I can get money from this, surely I could spend them on any means? Why should it be limited to Rapidshare account? I asked Mom to make me bank account with some money I’ve saved up. At the time, I was 14. I needed my Mom’s permission because I can’t open one myself.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’ve been enjoying Anime movies. Because my internet speed was slow, I decided to bought them online. I started to open Kaskus (similar to Craiglist) and bought a DVD or two. Eventually I realized that after I watched the movie, I could sell the CD. Even better: I could copy the CD, duplicate them, and start a business from that. I borrowed about IDR 200,000 (~$25) from my Mom and bought some CDs and copied them to my computer. </p>
<p>Bought some blank DVD’s for IDR 2,000 ($0.25) each, burned the Anime, and sell them for IDR 9,000 ($1.12) each. Business was good! I learned about marketing, design, and customer service. I started to buy DVD in bulk (cheaper) and spend most of my time home watching while burning the DVDs. Eventually, with enough capital, I started to buy some hard disk and offer a service to copy anime movies to hard drive at cheaper price. I sold 1TB of movie for IDR 900,000 at the time ($112.5). Pretty good deal right? As I have more capital, I started another business like selling t-shirt, flipping secondhand phone, and a lot more.</p>
<p>That was the best moment in my life, I could buy laptops, phone, and everything I wanted with my money. I’m the only person in school that already touched entrepreneurship. The downside? I don’t get time to spend with friends. Heck, I even don’t have one. I spend a lot of time for self learning and upscaling my business.</p>
<h2>It all stopped</h2><p>Eventually, I went to college. I got tired and decided to stop doing all of that. Instead, I wanted to enjoy life and spend time looking for friends. My Dad got promoted, so money was not a  concern anymore, although we still live thrifty. Old habit die hard, I guess. Unlike my brother and sister, I got “unlimited” money to spend. Why? My Dad knows me better: I would save up the money instead of buying foods to eat. He was worried about my health as I was very skinny. Because of that, I spent a lot of time going out with friends and literally stopped thinking about everything. Life was good.</p>
<p>That doesn’t last long though. On my third semester, college got more competitive—I got to know a lot of my colleagues. Some already have profitable business, some are super smart, some are critical, and some are charismatic. Believe me, it’s a very competitive environment. Then, the cycle starts again. I started to alienate myself and spend my time (again) learning things to catch up with them. I catch up hard.</p>
<p>As I went to business school, I got very hooked on one subject. It’s about branding. It piqued my interest. That’s the trigger when I started to learn how to design brand identity. I started to learn Photoshop, Illustrator, and other various design tools. That moment in college is also where I started to work on design gigs.</p>
<h2>After graduation</h2><p>Back in 2015, I finished my studies. I&#39;ve got some handful clients back in college and decided to start my own agency. I committed to do this for a year. If it doesn’t work, I’ll figure another way out. But then, a strange turn of event happens. A friend of mine asked me to help him build his company from scratch. </p>
<p>At first, I declined. I never wanted to work for anyone. I&#39;ve had bad experience back when I was interning at some companies. Having a full time job is the last thing I have in my mind. But in the end, he and his investor convinced me to join. I wrote my decision this on lengthy post before <a href="http://www.philipyoungg.com/thoughts/employed-vs-self-employed-my-decision-after-graduation">here</a>. </p>
<p>The company I worked for is called Bukapintu. The mission is to help fresh graduate land a culture fit job by educating them about careers, what to expect after graduated, and also show them interviews from their employees. On another hand, company benefitted by getting a written sponsored articles, a thorough details about &quot;who they are”, and quality—culture fit candidate. </p>
<p>I joined the company as UX/UI designer. My initial task is to design the UI and brand identity. We worked hand to hand with another agency to build the web application. </p>
<p>At first, everything was great. I learned how to design and work with the agency to deliver the result. But some problem surfaces: they didn’t work as fast as we expect—the application itself is not identical to what I&#39;ve made.</p>
<p>We ended up spending every morning at their place—make sure everything looks identical to the design. Afterwards, we spent the nights to design the interface. Weeks goes by and I got furious—I started to learn how to build the application by myself so we could move faster.</p>
<p>For months, I focused on my crafts, working, and learning nearly for 12 hours a day. We all worked hard. Soon enough, we got our first client, seed funding, tens of thousands of user, and some publication online.</p>
<h2>My first client (a big one)</h2><p>One evening, my girlfriend sent me an instagram account. It’s called @doyoutravel. At the time, he has 1.8M followers. He posted some amazing photos he took while traveling. I’m amazed. I binge scrolled for a while, then decided to check out his <a href="https://www.doyoutravel.com">website</a>. It’s horrendous. There’s issue everywhere and doesn’t particularly looks good on phone. So I sent wrote an email that says basically his website could do better and propose some solution on <a href="http://www.philipyoungg.com/projects/do-you-travel">how to fix it</a>. I hit sent and immediately went to bed. If you’re interested to see the email, reach out and I’ll send it to you 😊.</p>
<p>The next morning, I got an email back. It’s from him! We went back and forth multiple time until reached an agreement. I was super happy at the time and in disbelief: I didn’t know it was that <em>easy</em>. I can’t even sleep that night because of excitement. </p>
<p>What&#39;s crazy about the whole thing is, I never wrote code for clients my whole life. This is going to be my first time. I just move forward with full confidence that “I can do it” attitude and learn them as I go.</p>
<p>A week later, it’s finished. He’s super pleased with the result. Then he asked me my Paypal account. I immediately made one at the time and got the money transfered to Paypal. It feels surreal: I just made a month my current salary from 5 days work! I started to fantasize that I could do this full time and travel the world—just like what he do.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, another person emailed me to do some design &amp; development job. He’s from Stockholm, Sweden. He found my portfolio on Behance and interested to work together with me. That incident gave me confidence to quit my job. </p>
<h2>The reality</h2><p>Soon, I quit my job and start looking for clients. Then reality hit hards: I don’t get any client for 3 months. It’s not easy as I imagined it would be. I started thinking: how do I get client on the first place? I got the first one from sending an email (outreach), and the second one because he discovered me online. </p>
<p>Clearly, I don’t have any online persona that I could show to anyone. Then how people could discover me without it? I need to have a portfolio and tell people somehow that I’m available for work. I started to research where did designer and developer are on online. Found two place: Twitter, and Dribbble. </p>
<h2>How I marketed myself online</h2><p>The next few months, I curated my past projects and put them On Twitter, I followed some designer and developer that I respect. Almost everyday, I replied their tweets, joined conversations, and published my work incrementally there—hoping they’ll somehow check my profile out after I replied their tweets everyday.</p>
<p>The strategy works. After 2 months, I got an inquiry. It’s from a startup in San Francisco. They asked my availability and my interest to help them as contractor. I got paralyzed, it’s actually happening! It’s a long project—probably last for months. And also they asked what my rate is. </p>
<h2>Pricing</h2><p>At first, I want to charge $5,000 for three months work. That&#39;s a lot of money for me. But before doing that, I consulted to some people who are in this industry. Wanted to hear their opinion. So I DM’ed some contractor online and asked how much should I charge. One says $100/hr, other says $150/hr! Some are in between.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of money. I told them there’s no way I’ll charge client that much money. I’m uncomfortable with that. They said it’s actually a standard rate, some even charge $300/hr. One particular person told me that the company will earn way more money from my work, so I should just man up and charge them that.</p>
<p>After I got their advice, I waited until the clients reached me out. The moment of truths came. They asked what my rate was. I paused for a while and wrote a number similar to what those contractor told me. They said “OK”—probably in 2 seconds. </p>
<p>Can you imagine how I was feeling? I started screaming in my room, jumped uncontrollably, and told the news to my family and girlfriend. I’ve been waiting for this moment for 5 years, perfecting my craft, and it paid off.</p>
<p>Immediately after, I challenged myself to go to Canggu, Bali to get myself out of comfort zone. It stroke the perfect balance: it’s dominated with people who worked remotely from all over the world, but it still within Indonesia (where I live): I don’t need to think about SIM card, exchanging currency, and everything in between. My goal is to learn to speak English (so I can do video call with more confidence), try to live alone by myself, and test the hypothesis: whether I like travel or not.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So, that’s the story how I ended up becoming a designer and developer. If you been dreaming to do the same, no matter if you want to be a freelancer, photographer, or anything else believe me: you can do it. Just make sure you’re good at what you do (world class if you can), make a case study online, then promote it everywhere.</p>
<p>There’s clearly some story I didn’t wrote. Either I forgot to write about them, or I decided not to write it because of time constraint. Definitely reach me out if you have question(s). Would be happy to answer them. 😊</p>
